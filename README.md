# Video Clipper

This Python script allows you to split a video file into clips of a specified length and save them as .gif files. 

## Requirements

- Python 3
- moviepy

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the requirements by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the script by typing `python video_clipper.py` in your terminal.
4. When prompted, enter the path to the video file, the frame rate, the size scale (1 for original size, 0.5 for half, etc.), and the length of each clip in seconds.

The script will create a new directory in the same location as the video file, and save the clips as .gif files in this directory.
